# CIS Portfolio

Welcome to my CIS Portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of code samples I have written as part of my coursework and personal projects. While this isn't a collection of full projects, it offers a glimpse into my programming style, problem-solving skills, and knowledge of various programming concepts.

## Contents

This repository contains several files across different topics, including:

- **[Cantus Firmus]**: [A project that generates a string of 8 notes help you write melodies.]
- **[Chess Game]**: [A simple game chess that can be played in local multiplayer]
- **[ExposeBot]**: [My first attempt at making a discord bot.]

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide potential employers, collaborators, or instructors a sample of the code I've written. These files cover various aspects of my coding abilities, including:

- Algorithm design
- Data structures
- Problem-solving
- Clean and readable code

## How to Use

This repository doesn't come with any specific dependencies to run the files. You can simply review the code directly, or clone the repository if you'd like to explore it further.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-Jaustin/cis-portfolio.git
